    <desc lang="en">Mapp is still reeling from Lucia's victory at the summer fete and is left to watch disconsolately as the locals flock to her rival's little dinner parties across the street. Before long, however, she sees her chance for revenge. As the townsfolk busy themselves preparing their entries for the summer art exhibition, one of the highlights of the social calendar, Lucia and Georgie lay out their intentions to submit their sketches - giving Mapp a rather wicked idea to keep them out altogether. But it turns out that subterfuge rarely likes being hidden for long in a place like Tilling. Period comedy, starring Miranda Richardson, Anna Chancellor and Steve Pemberton.(n)</desc>
