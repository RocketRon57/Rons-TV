The Holy Father specially chose Dublin to host the World Meeting of Families 2018, the largest international gathering of families in the world. We meet up with the 100 strong group travelling from the Archdiocese of Birmingham to be part of the event and we're in Croke Park Stadium for the Festival of Families. One of the places Pope Francis will visit is Knock Shrine and Sean Fletcher finds out what draws 1.5 million pilgrims there every year. There's also another opportunity to see how Claire got on when she joined pilgrims climbing Croagh Patrick, known as Ireland's holy mountain, on Reek Sunday. Claire finds out why some young Christians choose to climb barefoot, despite the mountain being covered in sharp stones. There are hymns from Ireland and a performance of Amazing Grace by the group Celtic Woman, filmed on Clew Bay(n)</desc>

Great Yarmouth, September 1900 - a woman's body is found among the sand dunes. She had been murdered. The first mystery facing police was not identifying the killer but the woman herself - she had been staying in Great Yarmouth under an assumed name. A clue from her clothing allowed the police to name her as Mary Jane Bennett, and suspicion immediately landed on her estranged husband, Herbert Bennett. Now, over 100 years later, Herbert's great-grandson Paul is investigating the case, and he has doubts about his ancestor's guilt. Can a modern investigation shed new light on the evidence that was used to convict Herbert for murder? Sasha and Jeremy receive a breakthrough in the form of crucial physical evidence from the original investigation. Could this be the key to unlocking this mysterious case?(n)</desc>

But how much of what these products promise is based in scientific evidence, and how much is simply marketing manipulation?

In a groundbreaking study carried out by the University of Sheffield, and with the help of 25 volunteers, she discovers that moisturisers might not have the benefits people think they do. She meets dermatologists to find out how well her skin is really aging and sees the shocking effects of sun damage, and she discovers the only over-the-counter product scientists would use on their own wrinkles. Beauty journalist Sali Hughes shows Cherry how to save money on her make-up bag, and with the help of the University of Sunderland she puts common cellulite solutions to the test.

    <title lang="en">Pump up the Bhangra</title>
    <desc lang="en">BBC Asian Network DJ Bobby Friction presents a celebration of the way young British Asians have found their voice and their identity through Bhangra music over the past thirty years. The film tells the story of how a simple folk tradition from the wheat fields of north India was transformed in the 1980s to become a unique British club music - outselling many mainstream UK acts. Bobby traces the birth of bhangra amid the early Punjabi immigrants in the steel foundries of the West Midlands, and explores its glitzy heyday when, despite selling hundreds of thousands of records, artists remained unknown by the mainstream and failed to make it into the charts. Bhangra finally came to triumph and crossover to the mainstream when one Punjabi folk song was remixed with hip-hop beats by Jay-Z to become a global anthem(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary series focusing on the intelligence of whales and dolphins. Like humans, they have large brains, are quick to learn new behaviours and use a wide range of sounds to communicate with others. But how similar are their minds to ours? In the Bahamas, Professor Denise Herzing believes she is close to an answer, theorising that she will be able to hold a conversation with wild dolphins in their own language within five years. In Western Australia, dolphins rely on their versatile and inventive brains to survive in a marine desert, and in Alaska, humpback whales gather into alliances to increase their hunting success. The programme discovers how young spotted dolphins learn their individual names and the social etiquette of their pod, and how being curious about new objects leads Caribbean bottlenose dolphins to self-awareness and even self-obsession. Finally, we see a group of Mexican grey whales, who seem able to empathize with humans and may even have a concept of forgiveness(n)</desc>
