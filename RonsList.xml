Did Edith's infidelity influence the minds of the 1920s judge and jury? Can Jeremy and Sasha uncover crucial new evidence to clear Edith nearly 100 years later?(n)</desc>

Great Yarmouth, September 1900 - a woman's body is found among the sand dunes. She had been murdered. The first mystery facing police was not identifying the killer but the woman herself - she had been staying in Great Yarmouth under an assumed name. A clue from her clothing allowed the police to name her as Mary Jane Bennett, and suspicion immediately landed on her estranged husband, Herbert Bennett. Now, over 100 years later, Herbert's great-grandson Paul is investigating the case, and he has doubts about his ancestor's guilt. Can a modern investigation shed new light on the evidence that was used to convict Herbert for murder? Sasha and Jeremy receive a breakthrough in the form of crucial physical evidence from the original investigation. Could this be the key to unlocking this mysterious case?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Truth About Looking Good</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the UK over £9 billion a year are spent on beauty products that promise to improve and transform. But how much of what these products promise is based in scientific evidence, and how much is simply marketing manipulation? Cherry Healey teams up with independent scientists to put everyday cosmetics to the test. In a groundbreaking study carried out by the University of Sheffield, and with the help of 25 volunteers, she discovers that moisturisers might not have the benefits people think they do. She meets dermatologists to find out how well her skin is really aging and sees the shocking effects of sun damage, and she discovers the only over-the-counter product scientists would use on their own wrinkles. Beauty journalist Sali Hughes shows Cherry how to save money on her make-up bag, and with the help of the University of Sunderland she puts common cellulite solutions to the test. She also finds out the truth behind the common claims on cosmetics. episode 24(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary investigating America's most infamous supremacist group - the Ku Klux Klan. They say they are in the midst of a revival, with a surge in membership and cross burnings across the Deep South. Film-maker Dan Murdoch meets the leaders of the Loyal White Knights to witness first-hand their secretive rituals and hear about why their members choose to wear the infamous hood. The Klan says they are not violent. But when a 21-year-old white man walks into a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and massacres nine black worshippers saying he wants to start a race war, the danger of the white supremacist ideology becomes a terrifying reality. The film follows events as protests erupt and Black Power groups, including the New Black Panthers, take to the streets to preach their own agenda of black supremacy. And when the Ku Klux Klan and the New Black Panthers organise rival protests in the South Carolina capital, the two extreme visions of America violently come face to face(n)</desc>

Terry's trying to drum health and safety into the lads - and has decided to lose a day's takings and put them in a training session on cutting tools. It's money they can ill-afford to sacrifice - Lyndsay reveals that a few months ago they put their previous company into liquidation and used their own money to open a new business on the same site.

For thousands of years, Kazakh people of western Mongolia have had a hunting partnership with golden eagles to obtain furs to stay warm in the freezing winters. Gordon has a few painful lessons learning how to train and fly his young eagle. An eagle's training starts when it is less than a year old.

    <title lang="en">Pump up the Bhangra</title>
    <desc lang="en">BBC Asian Network DJ Bobby Friction presents a celebration of the way young British Asians have found their voice and their identity through Bhangra music over the past thirty years. The film tells the story of how a simple folk tradition from the wheat fields of north India was transformed in the 1980s to become a unique British club music - outselling many mainstream UK acts. Bobby traces the birth of bhangra amid the early Punjabi immigrants in the steel foundries of the West Midlands, and explores its glitzy heyday when, despite selling hundreds of thousands of records, artists remained unknown by the mainstream and failed to make it into the charts. Bhangra finally came to triumph and crossover to the mainstream when one Punjabi folk song was remixed with hip-hop beats by Jay-Z to become a global anthem(n)</desc>

Homes Under the Hammer star Martin Roberts joins entertainer Brian Conley to look back at the early TV moments that set him on the path to being the man he is now.

Martin's TV tastes were certainly eclectic, from early animation in the shape of Trumpton via the classic word game Call My Bluff. But how did all of these influences come together to make Martin one of our best-loved daytime presenters?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary series focusing on the intelligence of whales and dolphins. Like humans, they have large brains, are quick to learn new behaviours and use a wide range of sounds to communicate with others. But how similar are their minds to ours?

In Western Australia, dolphins rely on their versatile and inventive brains to survive in a marine desert, and in Alaska, humpback whales gather into alliances to increase their hunting success. The programme discovers how young spotted dolphins learn their individual names and the social etiquette of their pod, and how being curious about new objects leads Caribbean bottlenose dolphins to self-awareness and even self-obsession. Finally, we see a group of Mexican grey whales, who seem able to empathize with humans and may even have a concept of forgiveness(n)</desc>

The only problem is, he is totally unsuited to a life of sun, sea and sand - and worse still, it seems his boss back home wants him to stay there.

    <title lang="en">Super 8</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer-director-producer JJ Abrams followed his Star Trek reboot with this blend of sci-fi thriller and emotionally engaging first-romance story, starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. It's 1979 and 12-year-old Joe and his 8mm-movie-camera-owning friend Charles are secretly making a zombie flick for their local film festival. They've roped 14-year-old Alice into their project and she proves to be both an excellent actor and a romantic focus for the two boys. However, one night when the young moviemakers have snuck out to film a key scene, they witness - and record - a spectacular train crash. But there's more to the incident than meets the eye, as is demonstrated by the sudden appearance of the military on the scene, and the number of strange events that take place in the event's aftermath. And, as they investigate, the children begin to piece together the terrifying truth about what has happened... Co-produced by Steven Spielberg. Edited for language and violence(n)</desc>

In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway make a discovery on the Scottish island of Skye that suggests an extraterrestrial source for life on Earth. A decade later, those archaeologists are among the crew of the spaceship Prometheus, financed by the Weyland Corporation to explore unknown planets. Shortly after touching down on a remote world, Shaw and Holloway's Skye hypothesis appears to be confirmed by hard evidence. But excitement and jubilation quickly dissipate, as the hidden reason for their mission - and the great danger they are now in - begins to surface. With Fassbender as the crew's android; Theron as the Weyland official in charge of the operation; and Elba as captain of the Prometheus(n)</desc>

Derek Thompson is an ice hockey pro whose main tactic is flattening opponents - often depriving them of a tooth or two in the process. His aggression has earned him the nickname 'Tooth Fairy', but when he unsportingly tells his girlfriend's daughter that tooth fairies don't exist, the very real fairies decide to teach him a lesson. He's whipped away to Fairy Land, where he's sentenced to a week's community service as a tooth fairy. He sprouts wings, receives an outfit completely at odds with his macho image and is given a mentor. As the comedic misunderstandings and slapstick errors mount, it's all too clear that Thompson isn't cut out for his new line of work(n)</desc>

The present-day Duchess Emma introduces Phil to her Regency predecessor, Duchess Elizabeth, and allows Phil exclusive access to the Belvoir's usually off-limits archive. Phil learns that the castle's creators had to sell whole villages to fund the building work, and reveals the mind-boggling total cost in today's money. Phil encounters evidence of an aristocratic sex scandal painted on the ceiling, which was later disguised by royal decree. He searches for a lost railway under the castle, and tries his hand at modern-day pest control with a medieval twist(n)</desc>

They've sunk £150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar, which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is executive chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles... with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked. The restaurant manager, spunky Essex boy Dave, loathes his chef, and their mutual hatred spills over into permanent running battles. Faced with dysfunctional staff and a disastrous menu, Gordon is about to endure the longest week of his professional life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Bafta award-nominated series that lifts the lid on the uncensored drama of life in the playground continues. In last week's episode the girls and boys were kept apart, but now it's party time. Five of the girls and five of the boys return to the play centre, but how do they react when they find out that they have to share it with the opposite sex? And will our experiment bear out research that suggests that, at five years old, girls and boys often positively benefit from mixed gender groups? Last week, Jude, Oscar and the boys displayed some pretty well formed gender stereotypes. Now they're horrified to discover that there's a cross-dressing task and they must dress up as girls. Why don't the girls share their horror? And we found out that girls show signs of empathy from as young as three to four months and have better language and communication skills at five years old than boys do. But boys are generally less risk-averse and outperform girls at spatial awareness tasks(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">999: What's Your Emergency? focuses on the relentless work of Wiltshire's police, paramedic and fire services. Every year 10,000 new drivers pass their tests and gain access to the county's roads. For many young men, a car is more than a means of getting from A to B; it can mean freedom, status, excitement and also danger. Young drivers, and young male drivers in particular, are by far the least safe road users. PC Nick Finning is dispatched in search of a 'pool car' that's being driven at breakneck speed around residential streets. PC Finning explains that a pool car is 'a car that's been purchased normally for £200 or less... it won't be registered to anyone... it's untraceable and that vehicle is shared.' Some of Wiltshire's young men aren't even waiting to get their licences before taking to the roads. Joyriding, which had almost disappeared, has suddenly resurged in the county, and along with it come the crimes of car-key burglary and bilking(n)</desc>

Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing £8000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But the locals aren't biting and the restaurant's empty most nights. There's a sharp smell of déjà vu in the air for Gordon, whose own venture in Scotland - Amaryllis - had to close. Can Ramsay save La Riviera from the same fate(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">HARDtalk</title>
    <desc lang="en">Stephen Sackur talks to newsmakers and personalities from across the globe. When historians write their versions of Donald Trump's extraordinary ascent to the Presidency, prominence will surely be given to the former Director of the FBI James Comey. He was a Republican hired by a Democratic President, whose handling of two key investigations; into Hilary Clinton's emails and allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, polarised America. His recent memoir was a withering condemnation of the man who fired him, President Trump. But has James Comey sullied his own reputation by stepping into America's political swamp? First shown on the BBC News Channel on Tuesday 26 June(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stephen Sackur talks to newsmakers and personalities from across the globe. When historians write their versions of Donald Trump's extraordinary ascent to the Presidency, prominence will surely be given to the former Director of the FBI James Comey. He was a Republican hired by a Democratic President, whose handling of two key investigations; into Hilary Clinton's emails and allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, polarised America. His recent memoir was a withering condemnation of the man who fired him, President Trump. But has James Comey sullied his own reputation by stepping into America's political swamp?

    <desc lang="en">Andrew Shepherd is approaching the end of his first term as President of the United States. He's a widower with a young daughter and has proved to be popular with the public. His election seems assured. That is until he meets Sydney Ellen Wade, a paid political activist working for an environmental lobby group. He's immediately smitten with her and after several amusing attempts, they finally manage to go on a date (which happens to be a State dinner for the visiting President of France). His relationship with Wade opens the door for his prime political opponent, Senator Bob Rumson, to launch an attack on the President's character, something he could not do in the previous election as Shepherd's wife had only recently died(n)</desc>

Hoping to steal the book he believes is his last chance to rule what is left of humanity, Carnegie sets out to catch Eli, while Carnegie's step-daughter also follows Eli on his quest. As Carnegie and his henchmen hunt Eli down, they soon discover what a powerful and fearsome adversary he really is(n)</desc>

And they're decidedly hostile - their plan is to suck the planet of all its resources and leave behind a burnt cinder circling the sun before moving on. Planting giant ships above the world's major cities, they unleash destruction on an unprecedented scale (superbly caught by the special effects). All attempts at fighting back are met by hordes of fighter craft until pilot Steven Hiller manages to down one and capture the pilot. In tandem, scientist David Levinson, having worked out their purpose, also works out a way to destroy them but he and Hiller need a space craft. Which brings them to a secret base near Las Vegas. The child of countless science fiction movies, Independence Day is rollicking, fast-moving fun and if the fate of the remains of the human race is never in doubt, there's enough tension and action to carry even the most jaundiced viewer along(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Independence Day (1996)</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster of a science fiction film sees aliens reach Earth. And they're decidedly hostile - their plan is to suck the planet of all its resources and leave behind a burnt cinder circling the sun before moving on. Planting giant ships above the world's major cities, they unleash destruction on an unprecedented scale (superbly caught by the special effects). All attempts at fighting back are met by hordes of fighter craft until pilot Steven Hiller manages to down one and capture the pilot. In tandem, scientist David Levinson, having worked out their purpose, also works out a way to destroy them but he and Hiller need a space craft. Which brings them to a secret base near Las Vegas. The child of countless science fiction movies, Independence Day is rollicking, fast-moving fun and if the fate of the remains of the human race is never in doubt, there's enough tension and action to carry even the most jaundiced viewer along(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a shy woman recently discharged from a mental institution into the care of her dysfunctional family. Searching for work, she takes a lowly clerical job with dour, demanding attorney James Spader. Critical of her mistakes, one day, verbal abuse crosses to physical, as he spanks her. But she seems to thrive on his treatment and a reciprocal relationship begins until Spader, finding she enjoys the humiliation, fires her. Bereft, and with her boyfriend Jeremy Davies unable to fulfil her desires, she plans to win back Spader's affections. Steven Shainberg's film could have been crudely exploitative but thanks to the delicacy of his treatment, the subtlety of the two central performances, plus a leavening of humour, this is a story of unconventional love but love for all that(n)</desc>

Jane Adler is the proprietor of a thriving bakery in a moneyed town in southern California. Jake is her former husband - a successful lawyer and the father to her three children - who's now remarried to the much younger, exceedingly svelte Agness. Complications start to arise when Jane and Jake attend their youngest son's graduation ceremony; they have dinner together afterward, which leads ultimately to the bedroom. He's something of an expert in the field of infidelity but she also finds the old spark still there and, to her surprise, wants more. The complexity in Jane's life deepens when charming architect Adam Schaffer appears on the scene. What's a woman to do? Pursue the excitement she's found with Jake, or opt for potential comfort with divorcé Adam? And will their lack of discretion lead to Jane and Jake being caught out in the meantime?(n)</desc>

The tale kicks off in 1845 with the incident that sparked the young James Howlett's initial mutation and his alliance with Victor Creed. Over the course of the next century the two immerse themselves in a series of major conflicts, right up to the Vietnam War, where they are recruited by Major Stryker to join Team X: a killing machine staffed by other mutants. Uncomfortable with the merciless, legally dubious methods the unit employs, Howlett leaves, seeking a quiet life. Over the course of the next few years, Howlett, now known as Logan, seems to have realised his dream, having settled down with his girlfriend Kayla. However, a violent, catastrophic incident turns Logan's world upside down, propelling him on a course that will result in confrontation with his former ally Creed, as well as Logan's final transmogrification into Wolverine.

Without his mojo, the agent will not be strong enough to prevent the villain from firing a laser on the Earth. Although disheartened, Austin also travels in time and discovers that the criminal now has new allies -such as the dwarf clone, Mini-Mim (Verne Troyer) and the repugnant Igor Dan (once again, Myers). With the help of the beautiful agent, Felicity Fasobem (Heather Graham), Austin must strive to defeat the enemy and recover his vitality.

American officer Aldo Raine leads a squad of soldiers into occupied France on a Dirty-Dozen-style assassination mission to kill as many Nazis as possible and spread fear through the Third Reich. They become involved in a Jewish resistance fighter's plan to blow up the Parisian premiere of one of Goebbels' propaganda films - an event due to be attended by Hitler himself. Inglourious Basterds features the entertainingly showy performances, encyclopaedic movie references and oodles of self-conscious dialogue that you'd expect from a Tarantino film, as well as a superb turn from Christoph Waltz as a charmingly evil SS colonel. In English, and German, French and Italian with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inglourious Basterds (2009)</title>
    <desc lang="en">Quentin Tarantino's history-tweaking homage to the war movie sees the director back on exhilarating form. American officer Aldo Raine leads a squad of soldiers into occupied France on a Dirty-Dozen-style assassination mission to kill as many Nazis as possible and spread fear through the Third Reich. They become involved in a Jewish resistance fighter's plan to blow up the Parisian premiere of one of Goebbels' propaganda films - an event due to be attended by Hitler himself. Inglourious Basterds features the entertainingly showy performances, encyclopaedic movie references and oodles of self-conscious dialogue that you'd expect from a Tarantino film, as well as a superb turn from Christoph Waltz as a charmingly evil SS colonel. In English, and German, French and Italian with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inglourious Basterds (2009)</title>
    <desc lang="en">Quentin Tarantino's history-tweaking homage to the war movie sees the director back on exhilarating form. American officer Aldo Raine leads a squad of soldiers into occupied France on a Dirty-Dozen-style assassination mission to kill as many Nazis as possible and spread fear through the Third Reich. They become involved in a Jewish resistance fighter's plan to blow up the Parisian premiere of one of Goebbels' propaganda films - an event due to be attended by Hitler himself. Inglourious Basterds features the entertainingly showy performances, encyclopaedic movie references and oodles of self-conscious dialogue that you'd expect from a Tarantino film, as well as a superb turn from Christoph Waltz as a charmingly evil SS colonel. In English, and German, French and Italian with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matt Reeves' smart monster thriller has been favourably compared to The Blair Witch Project , with which it shares the concept of using "found" camcorder footage to reveal its horrors. The film opens at a party for Manhattan yuppie Rob Hawkins where the revelries are interrupted by a loud explosion. As he and his friends Hud, Jason, Marlena and Lily emerge onto the street, the head of the Statue of Liberty cartwheels past them. Something very big, scaly and angry is trashing the city, and one of the targets is a high-rise where Beth, Rob's girlfriend lives. The group set out in a rescue bid, with Hud recording everything as they make their way through what has become a nightmarish New York, threatened both by the monster (only ever half-glimpsed, making it even more terrifying) and the parasitic lice it sheds, which develop a taste for human flesh. Will all, or indeed any, of the group make it to safety? The footage tells their stories in shocking, handheld detail in this superbly paced movie(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cloverfield (2008)</title>
    <desc lang="en">Matt Reeves' smart monster thriller has been favourably compared to The Blair Witch Project , with which it shares the concept of using "found" camcorder footage to reveal its horrors. The film opens at a party for Manhattan yuppie Rob Hawkins where the revelries are interrupted by a loud explosion. As he and his friends Hud, Jason, Marlena and Lily emerge onto the street, the head of the Statue of Liberty cartwheels past them. Something very big, scaly and angry is trashing the city, and one of the targets is a high-rise where Beth, Rob's girlfriend lives. The group set out in a rescue bid, with Hud recording everything as they make their way through what has become a nightmarish New York, threatened both by the monster (only ever half-glimpsed, making it even more terrifying) and the parasitic lice it sheds, which develop a taste for human flesh. Will all, or indeed any, of the group make it to safety? The footage tells their stories in shocking, handheld detail in this superbly paced movie(n)</desc>
