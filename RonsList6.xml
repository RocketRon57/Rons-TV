    <title lang="en">Murder, Mystery and My Family</title>
    <desc lang="en">Top barristers Sasha Wass and Jeremy Dein re-examine a seaside case of murder and mistaken identity from 1900, in a case involving false names, suspicious journeys and 100-year-old evidence. Great Yarmouth, September 1900 - a woman's body is found among the sand dunes. She had been murdered. The first mystery facing police was not identifying the killer but the woman herself - she had been staying in Great Yarmouth under an assumed name. A clue from her clothing allowed the police to name her as Mary Jane Bennett, and suspicion immediately landed on her estranged husband, Herbert Bennett. Now, over 100 years later, Herbert's great-grandson Paul is investigating the case, and he has doubts about his ancestor's guilt. Can a modern investigation shed new light on the evidence that was used to convict Herbert for murder? Sasha and Jeremy receive a breakthrough in the form of crucial physical evidence from the original investigation. Could this be the key to unlocking this mysterious case?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the UK over £9 billion a year are spent on beauty products that promise to improve and transform. But how much of what these products promise is based in scientific evidence, and how much is simply marketing manipulation? Cherry Healey teams up with independent scientists to put everyday cosmetics to the test. In a groundbreaking study carried out by the University of Sheffield, and with the help of 25 volunteers, she discovers that moisturisers might not have the benefits people think they do. She meets dermatologists to find out how well her skin is really aging and sees the shocking effects of sun damage, and she discovers the only over-the-counter product scientists would use on their own wrinkles. Beauty journalist Sali Hughes shows Cherry how to save money on her make-up bag, and with the help of the University of Sunderland she puts common cellulite solutions to the test. She also finds out the truth behind the common claims on cosmetics. episode 24(n)</desc>

They say they are in the midst of a revival, with a surge in membership and cross burnings across the Deep South. Film-maker Dan Murdoch meets the leaders of the Loyal White Knights to witness first-hand their secretive rituals and hear about why their members choose to wear the infamous hood. The Klan says they are not violent. But when a 21-year-old white man walks into a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and massacres nine black worshippers saying he wants to start a race war, the danger of the white supremacist ideology becomes a terrifying reality. The film follows events as protests erupt and Black Power groups, including the New Black Panthers, take to the streets to preach their own agenda of black supremacy. And when the Ku Klux Klan and the New Black Panthers organise rival protests in the South Carolina capital, the two extreme visions of America violently come face to face(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">BBC Asian Network DJ Bobby Friction presents a celebration of the way young British Asians have found their voice and their identity through Bhangra music over the past thirty years. The film tells the story of how a simple folk tradition from the wheat fields of north India was transformed in the 1980s to become a unique British club music - outselling many mainstream UK acts. Bobby traces the birth of bhangra amid the early Punjabi immigrants in the steel foundries of the West Midlands, and explores its glitzy heyday when, despite selling hundreds of thousands of records, artists remained unknown by the mainstream and failed to make it into the charts. Bhangra finally came to triumph and crossover to the mainstream when one Punjabi folk song was remixed with hip-hop beats by Jay-Z to become a global anthem(n)</desc>

In Western Australia, dolphins rely on their versatile and inventive brains to survive in a marine desert, and in Alaska, humpback whales gather into alliances to increase their hunting success. The programme discovers how young spotted dolphins learn their individual names and the social etiquette of their pod, and how being curious about new objects leads Caribbean bottlenose dolphins to self-awareness and even self-obsession.

    <desc lang="en">A group of celebrities travel to Udaipur in India to test retirement there. The group are now settled into life in Udaipur and are ready to explore further afield. Country lovers Bob, Susan and Selina want to see more of rural Rajasthan and head into the hills to go horse riding and camping, but it is not quite the trip they imagined. Over the campfire they open up about the difficult times in their lives. Meanwhile, in Udaipur, Syd and Ian continue their Indian cookery lessons, Stanley relives his youth on the back of a motorcycle, and Stephanie explores her inner self through meditation. The group end the week with a trip to Gujarat for one of India's biggest annual festivals, Navratri, but to get there involves a 12-hour journey on a sleeper train. After attempting to learn a Gujarati folk dance, they get kitted out in traditional costumes and join thousands of worshippers for a night of celebrations for the Hindu warrior goddess Durga(n)</desc>

Enter DI Richard Poole, a brilliant detective with a unique approach to cracking crime, and just the man to solve the mystery of his colleague's death. The only problem is, he is totally unsuited to a life of sun, sea and sand - and worse still, it seems his boss back home wants him to stay there.

But then a local boat crew fish a corpse out of the sea, with two gunshot wounds to the head - just as Megan said.

It's 1979 and 12-year-old Joe and his 8mm-movie-camera-owning friend Charles are secretly making a zombie flick for their local film festival. They've roped 14-year-old Alice into their project and she proves to be both an excellent actor and a romantic focus for the two boys. However, one night when the young moviemakers have snuck out to film a key scene, they witness - and record - a spectacular train crash. But there's more to the incident than meets the eye, as is demonstrated by the sudden appearance of the military on the scene, and the number of strange events that take place in the event's aftermath. And, as they investigate, the children begin to piece together the terrifying truth about what has happened... Co-produced by Steven Spielberg. Edited for language and violence(n)</desc>

They've sunk £150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar, which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is executive chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles... with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked. The restaurant manager, spunky Essex boy Dave, loathes his chef, and their mutual hatred spills over into permanent running battles. Faced with dysfunctional staff and a disastrous menu, Gordon is about to endure the longest week of his professional life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Bafta award-nominated series that lifts the lid on the uncensored drama of life in the playground continues. In last week's episode the girls and boys were kept apart, but now it's party time. Five of the girls and five of the boys return to the play centre, but how do they react when they find out that they have to share it with the opposite sex? And will our experiment bear out research that suggests that, at five years old, girls and boys often positively benefit from mixed gender groups? Last week, Jude, Oscar and the boys displayed some pretty well formed gender stereotypes. Now they're horrified to discover that there's a cross-dressing task and they must dress up as girls. Why don't the girls share their horror? And we found out that girls show signs of empathy from as young as three to four months and have better language and communication skills at five years old than boys do. But boys are generally less risk-averse and outperform girls at spatial awareness tasks(n)</desc>

Despite their attempts to help, eventually all they can do is send an officer to arrest him to keep the lines free for life and death emergencies(n)</desc>

Every year 10,000 new drivers pass their tests and gain access to the county's roads. For many young men, a car is more than a means of getting from A to B; it can mean freedom, status, excitement and also danger. Young drivers, and young male drivers in particular, are by far the least safe road users. PC Nick Finning is dispatched in search of a 'pool car' that's being driven at breakneck speed around residential streets. PC Finning explains that a pool car is 'a car that's been purchased normally for £200 or less... it won't be registered to anyone... it's untraceable and that vehicle is shared.' Some of Wiltshire's young men aren't even waiting to get their licences before taking to the roads. Joyriding, which had almost disappeared, has suddenly resurged in the county, and along with it come the crimes of car-key burglary and bilking(n)</desc>
